In order to elude such a cruel fate, they escaped their realm finding or fabricating bodies for their spirits and starting lives away from their home land. Some of them followed their mother Inari, while others forged their own paths. Those under Inari's leadership and guidance, resorted to possession as a way to acquire physical forms. They created a beautiful and powerful city though due to a clash with the Crimson Legion, their nation fell and soon after so did Inari, leading the survivors to scatter across the world approximately 4 years ago. Many of them are known for their cold and standoffish nature and tend to be logical and focused on survival."

In other cases, some worshippers of Aurora or people that find themselves in great need are rumored to have received a blessing, providing them with Kitsune-like characteristics and divine powers.
